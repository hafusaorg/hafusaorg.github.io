COMMUNITY PROGRAM
{: .figcaption}

# Learn to fight like a girl on a mission

Our training course focuses on simple techniques and common-sense safety principles. No prior experience with self-defense is necessary to participate in our trainings—just an open mind and a willingness to learn.
</section>

A GREAT PARTNERSHIP
{: .figcaption}

# We are partnering with Southern California Girl Scout Troops to empower young women to transform into their strongest selves.

Here is a handy [Informational Brochure][informational-brochure] for your reference.

WHY ARE WE PARTNERING WITH GIRL SCOUT TROOPS?
{: .figcaption}

## The reality is that women between the ages of 18 to 32 are among the most vulnerable to physical and/or sexual assault. 

According to [RAINN](https://rainn.org), this age group represents well over half of all sexual assaults against women. We are partnering with Girl Scout Troops so we can teach girls who have entered or are just about to enter this vulnerable age range to defend themselves. Our goal is to equip young women with the knowledge, resources, and confidence to successfully defend themselves—and prevent them from becoming a number in an assault statistic.

THE BOTTOM LINE: WHAT WILL YOUR GIRL SCOUTS WALK AWAY WITH?
{: .figcaption}

## The girls will develop a greater awareness of dangerous situations, be equipped with simple defense and escape movements, and gain the confidence to use their voice to fend-off an attacker.

Hear from Jen, a Girl Scout Leader who has participated in our training:

> “We worry about (our kids’) surroundings all the time. You’re hearing about all kinds of dangers and you know that they have to go out there no matter what, you can’t keep them hidden. So working with Harmony Aikido, the parents can see the change, the kids can understand. I think the kids are especially receptive to it because it’s not coming from a parent—it is coming from a group of young adults that know what they’re talking about, and can present it in a very approachable style.”

## What to expect at our training

We seek to impart a mindset of safety that everyone can use for a lifetime. To that end, we have worked hard to create a space for the girls to learn, discuss, and practice together. Our training course focuses on simple techniques, common-sense safety principles. No prior experience with self-defense is necessary to participate in our trainings—just an open mind and a willingness to learn.

Here are the specfic things that the girls will learn during our workshop as exemplified in our session with the **Girl Scouts of South Pasadena**:
