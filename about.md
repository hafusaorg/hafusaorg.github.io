WHAT WE DO
{: .figcaption}

# We provide self-defense training to local communities in the Los Angeles County and the greater Los Angeles area.

We teach practical awareness and self-defense skills to participants of all ages and from all walks of life. No prior experience is necessaryâ€”just an open mind, a humble spirit, and a wilingness to learn.
