# Our approach

We offer a combination of situational training with an emphasis on practical techniques that are effective in real-life situations.  Our classes are small insize (usually between 15 - 25 people), which enables us to offer a highly interactive learning experience where attendees can ask questions and join in discussions.  

We encourage our attendees to  actively join in, contribute their own experiences, and challenge one another to ask practical questions and find real answers. We find this interactive style of group learning to be highly effective in learning not only physical responses to violence but also learning ways to foresee potential violence and avoid it if possible)
