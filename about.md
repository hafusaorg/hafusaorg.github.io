WHAT WE DO

# We provide self-defense training to local communities in the Los Angeles County and the greater Los Angeles area.

We teach practical awareness and self-defense skills to participants of all ages and from all walks of life. No prior experience is necessary—just an open mind, a humble spirit, and a wilingness to learn.

Our classes are small insize (usually between 15 - 25 people). Because of the size of our classes, we are able to offer a highly interactive learning experience where attendees can ask questions and join in discussions.  We encourage our attendees to  actively join in, contribute their own experiences, and challenge one another to learn. We find that these group exercises where we encourage attendees to reflect on practical applications of what they just learned extremely effective in reinforcing the lessons they just learned.
