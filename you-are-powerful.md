OUR CAMPAIGN
{: .figcaption}

## We are on a mission to equip 1,000 women and girls with the necessary situational awareness and physical training to avoid violence when possible, and the ability to protect themselves and loved ones when necessary. 

Our training session includes three aspects of self defense training. The first is situational awareness training, the best line of defense against violence- foreseeing dangerous situations and avoiding them. The second is the War Cry, to be used when danger is imminent- the best way to warn an attacker and embolden yourself to fight if necessary. The third aspect and last resort is physical training that includes striking practice, blocking practice and other lock and evasion techniques.
