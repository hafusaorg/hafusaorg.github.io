THE VISION

# We see a future where violence is met with empowered strength.

# Community programs

We partner with local organizations in providing self-defense workshop to communities. Our goal is to increase our participants’ situational awareness and give them the ability to react safely in response to dangerous situations—or to prevent them from occurring in the first place. No previous training is necessary, just a willingness to learn.

> “Harmony Aikido Foundation (HAF) participated in our Sisters Empowerment and did an absolutely amazing job. The young girls enjoyed themselves so much—you could tell by how engaged they were in the different activities. Not only was the HAF crew hands on with showing them some moves, they also taught the girls some valuable lessons when it comes to being aware and using their voices. These girls were taught something they can take into their daily lives and we are extremely grateful!”
