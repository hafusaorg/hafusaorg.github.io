THE VISION
{: .figcaption}

# We see a future where violence no longer tears the fabric of our communities.

Harmony Aikido Foundation takes a preventative approach towards violence by equipping people to defend themselves and their loved ones against physical attacks. We partner with local community groups to provide high-quality self-defense and awareness training for community members of all ages.
